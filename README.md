1) Classification of mathematicians from the humanities based on the oscillatory activity of the EEG 
when performing arithmetic and verbal tasks\
ihna_classification_mat_versus_hum_tasks.ipynb
2) Classification of mathematicians from the humanities based on the oscillatory activity of the EEG recorded at rest 
(Eyes open)\
ihna_classification_mat_versus_hum_resting_state.ipynb
3) Prediction of the age of children and adolescents based on ERPs upon presentation of stimuli
of varying intensity\

Preliminary results were presented on FENS 2022 (neurodevelopment section)\
