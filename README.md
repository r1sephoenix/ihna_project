Tools for processing ERPs and oscillatory activity of EEG

With the help of these tools, the following projects were carried out:

1) Classification of mathematicians from the humanities based on the oscillatory activity of the EEG 
when performing arithmetic and verbal tasks\

2) Classification of mathematicians from the humanities based on the oscillatory activity of the EEG recorded at rest 
(Eyes open)\

3) Prediction of the age of children and adolescents based on ERPs upon presentation of stimuli
of varying intensity\

Preliminary results were presented on FENS 2022 (neurodevelopment section)\
